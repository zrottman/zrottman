### Hi, I'm Zach 👋

I'm an art historian-and-erstwhile-WordPress-developer-turned-engineer who loves lower-level, infrastructure-y projects, crunching data, and anything involving bit manipulation. If there's one thing my former life as an academic shares with my current one, it's a love of building complicated and carefully structured things from first principles: I am happiest when I'm descending through layers of abstraction and ecstatic when [I have reached bedrock and my spade is turned](https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/biographical/wittgenstein-ludwig-josef-johann-1889-1951/v-1/sections/the-later-picture-of-meaning-1).

I'm currently finishing up my batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-directed coding retreat, where I've been focusing on infrastructure and networking projects in Python and C and generally pairing and collaborating as much as possible.

- 🔭 Currently working on: a [disassembler](https://github.com/zrottman/disassembler) for the [ForwardCom instruction set architecture](https://www.forwardcom.info/), a [DNS resolver](https://github.com/zrottman/dns_c), and a [compiler for a Java-like language](https://github.com/zrottman/nand2tetris/tree/main/projects/10) for [Nand to Tetris](https://github.com/zrottman/nand2tetris)
- 🌱 Currently learning: C, networking fundamentals, Lisp/Scheme
- 🧐 Languages I'm excited to learn next: Rust, Elixir, Clojure
- 🛠️ Projects I'm excited to tackle next: building a text editor in C, building an interpreter, *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*, [Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/blog/gossip-glomers/), [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/), [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/)
